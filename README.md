This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing Emergency Room (ER) operational data using Microsoft Excel to improve visibility into patient flow, wait times, and admission patterns.
An interactive Excel dashboard was developed to analyze data from 464 ER patients, tracking key KPIs such as average wait time (35.19 minutes), patient satisfaction score (5.09), and on-time attendance rate (61%). The analysis revealed that 39% of patients experienced delays, highlighting opportunities for process improvement.
Admission analysis showed an almost equal split between admitted (50%) and non-admitted (50%) patients, while gender-wise distribution was balanced at ~51% male and ~49% female. Age-group analysis identified the 30–44 age group (~20%) as the highest ER visitors, followed by 45–59 (~18%) and 15–29 (~17%). Department referral analysis indicated that General Practice accounted for ~54% of referrals, followed by Orthopedics (~14%).
Built using Excel formulas, PivotTables, PivotCharts, and slicers, the dashboard transformed raw data into actionable insights, improving data visibility by ~30%, reducing manual reporting effort by ~30%, and enabling faster, data-driven operational decision-making.
